This is Ð° GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Caucasiana](https://caucasiana.pensoft.net/).

**Caucasiana** is a peer-reviewed, open-access, rapidly disseminated journal launched to accelerate research and information exchange in biodiversity-related disciplines in the Caucasus region and adjacent areas. We offer free-of-charge publishing service for authors, augmenting the limited research resources in the region.

**Caucasiana** aims at providing a platform for accumulating primary biodiversity data and understanding the biodiversity as a whole in the Caucasus and adjacent regions, from individuals to ecosystems. While we are particularly interested in taxonomic inventory and systematics of Caucasus biodiversity, any study related to biodiversity can be accepted for publication, with due consideration to the merits and quality of research contained in the work.

**Caucasiana** will consider manuscripts for publishing on the following topics:

* taxonomy and systematics (descriptions of new taxa, keys and revisions)
* biodiversity inventory (checklists and catalogues, data papers on single or multiple taxa provided the high accuracy and value of a given information)
* phylogenetics and evolutionary analyses
* biogeography
* ecology (from single species to community scale)
* behavioral sciences
* conservation, biodiversity management and policy
* interdisciplinary research related to biodiversity
